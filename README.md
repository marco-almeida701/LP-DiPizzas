## Introduction
DiPizza is a responsive pizza ordering website that provides users with a delightful and straightforward experience when ordering their favorite pizzas online. The website offers information about the pizza shop, a menu with various pizza options, and contact details for getting in touch. This project was developed for educational purposes to enhance web development skills, and it is entirely fictional.

## Technologies Used
The website is built using the following technologies:

**HTML5:** Markup language for structuring the website's content.

**CSS3:** Styling language for designing the website's layout and appearance.

**JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and enhances user experience.

**Bootstrap Icons:** Icon library used for social media icons and other visual elements.

## Responsive Design
DiPizza is designed to be responsive and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. The website utilizes media queries and flexbox to ensure a smooth user experience on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

**Desktop View:** The website layout is optimized for desktop screens, with a prominent header and navigation bar, eye-catching visuals, and a two-column section for the "About Us" page.

**Tablet View:** As the screen size decreases to tablet dimensions, the navigation bar is transformed into three dots (hamburger menu) on the top-right corner. When clicked, the navigation menu slides in from the left.

**Mobile View:** For smaller screens, such as smartphones, the website further adapts by vertically stacking the content, ensuring a pleasant and easy-to-navigate experience.

## Interactions
The website features the following interactive elements:

**Navigation Menu:** When viewing the website on smaller screens (tablet and mobile), the navigation menu is hidden behind a hamburger menu (three dots). Clicking the menu icon reveals the navigation options.

**Pizza Requests:** On the menu section, each pizza has a "Request" button. While it doesn't have a backend functionality, it demonstrates the potential for future integration with a real ordering system.

**Toggle Animation:** The website features a JavaScript toggle animation that enables users to click on the hamburger menu and toggle the appearance of the navigation menu.

# How to Use
To use the DiPizza website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website will load, and you can explore its various sections, including the home page, about us, menu, and contact information.

**Navigation:** On desktop, the navigation menu is visible at the top of the page. On smaller screens, click the three dots icon to access the navigation menu.

**Pizza Selection:** On the "Menu" section, you can view different pizza options, along with their pricing for various sizes (6 slices, 8 slices, and 12 slices). Click the "Request" button to simulate requesting a particular pizza (note that this feature is not connected to any backend system).

**Responsive View:** To experience the website's responsive design, you can resize the browser window to see how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
